## Terraform Resource Naming Conventions
Terraform resources should be named following a clear, consistent pattern that reflects the environment, purpose, and type of resource. 

## Python Integration
When Terraform resource names change, these can be reflected in Python through the use of Terraform outputs and environment variables.

## Terraform Outputs
Outputs can be defined in Terraform to expose resource properties, such as an SQS queue URL, which can then be used in Python code.

```hcl
output "order_processing_queue_url" {
  value = aws_sqs_queue.order_processing_queue_dev.url
}
