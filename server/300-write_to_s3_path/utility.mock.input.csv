2023-11-03-22-17-02196-001000.flac," been on a lot of podcasts, but like, they're usually kind of
 small, you know, it's like
"
2023-11-03-22-18-35198-001001.flac," I see you guys as like Joe Rogan for business.
 So it's like this one step above is like Joe Rogan
 and then there's you guys and then below is like,
 yeah, I don't wanna diss all the podcasts
 I've been on, they're amazing.
 But you know, like, this is like a level.
 So, but it's good, you know.
 I'm a big fan.
 It's a few levels.
 So, and you also don't know what Sam might ask you
 because Sam might just come out of left field
 and be like.
 No, but that's the thing.
 I was thinking like Sam is like,
 he's not a regular interviewer.
 You know, he asks some crazy shit, so.
 Wait, me?
 First of all, I don't know if that's true.
 I don't know if we, first of all, it's not just me.
 It's you too, Sean, that asks weird stuff.
 But also, I don't think we ask that weird questions.
 I think we ask the questions that everyone's thinking.
 That's true.
 But I mean, you're not Yes Man.
 Like, you know, there's Yes Man podcast
 where like they just, it's kind of like a fan thing.
 Obviously that's not you guys.
 You have real shit, real questions.
 And that's, I think it's more interesting as well.
 Can we, Sam, can we share the thing
 you were just telling us in Slack?
 Can I share that on here on the pod?
 Yeah, which one?
 This is Sam Parr's strategy for networking.
 This is, you know, you can go to Harvard.
 You can go to Stanford.
 You're not gonna learn this one.
 Sam has this habit where if, like, you know,
 it's a very small little tweak,
 but it's just so Sam that it just is awesome.
 So if you're, if Sam wants to hang out with you,
 he'll text you just like a normal person would.
 But, and he doesn't need to even know you.
 He's just like interested in you.
 Maybe it's a cold DM.
 Maybe it's a text message.
 Maybe he got your number from somebody else.
 Like, hey, it's Sam.
 You know, I'm in San Francisco,
 but instead of saying, wanna hang?
"
2023-11-03-22-20-20201-001002.flac," Same we'll just go. I'm in San Francisco. Let's
 You send me some shit that I want
 What what is this and why does it work so well
 It's like a phrase like, you know, like people will be like, you know, I fuck with that guy like I fuck with Drake
 I like Drake it
 Extends from that and I just say it and people
 They reply I don't know I just yeah this particular one
 I it was a CEO of a multi-billion dollar company who I'm friendly with. I just said what's up? I'm in your hood
 Let's and he goes down when?
 Like it worked out. It's amazing. And now so normally we try to play it cool, but we've actually been chasing you Peter
 We've been we've been talking about your projects. We've been being like, hey, we got to get this guy in the pod
 Sam is a fan of you for sure
 I would say I am less of a fan than Sam, but I am a and that doesn't mean I like you
 It's just I'm more in the closet about it. Whereas Sam is very
 Sam's like this guy's amazing. This guy's like an artist. This guy's got great hair and you do have great hair
 So it's all true
 Finally got you here and it was hard. I think right cuz you like don't do you don't schedule or something like that?
 like I mean
 Like it looks like being an ass, right?
 But I
 Like you guys I would get so many DMS and they're all like I mean generally very low-quality DMS, right?
 Like I want to collaborate but I don't want to invest I don't want to like you want something from you
 I think it's like being a hot girl in the club like people want something for you
 But they don't want to invest the time to actually get to know you or you know
 you feel like an object and I don't like to feel like that and I want to
 spend more time with
"
2023-11-03-22-20-29202-001003.flac," you know, like with my friends in real life, with my girlfriend or something.
 I want to spend time in the gym, you know, on my health and cooking food and.
"
2023-11-03-22-20-32202-001004.flac," that kind of stuff, go for walks and.
"
2023-11-03-22-21-53203-001005.flac," I think because I because I've been doing this for 10 years like started like eight years and now
 I get the money's going well so I don't really need to do any calls anymore any dms so I'm just
 trying to create a more chill life and I'm not an asshole it just means like I don't have time to
 met to reply to everybody so I close my dms and and then people got really angry on twitter like
 why don't you why do you close your jams are you arrogant and stuff so I wrote a blog post like
 kind of explaining my day and my routine and what I do in a day and that I don't really have time
 if I do all the things I do now to also dm everybody and reply everybody and do calls and
 stuff um and that's pretty much the argument argument let's give the context so let's explain
 who you who the heck you are so uh your name is peter levels you're known on um twitter as levels
 io right yeah that's the uh that's the right way to say it I saw you a while back I'm just
 going to say some interesting things about you I believe that you can correct me if I have any of
 these wrong I believe you publish how much you make every year and in fact it's in your twitter
 bio in your location there's like a meter that's like your road to three million a year yeah and
 it says 2.7 million so your your meter is almost all the way full filled up um you build a bunch
 of random small projects usually around some things you like or believe or your lifestyle
 which is kind of a nomadic lifestyle so I believe uh
"
2023-11-03-22-24-29209-001006.flac," I think you hop around or you don't have a home base, so you live, you know, you could be like in
 Bali and then you could be in the Netherlands, you could be a different place all the time.
 And you make these small websites or apps, and it says in your bio that you have 13 million
 monthly active users. And I remember seeing you because you did a community, like a nomad
 community, a Slack community really early on, like Slack had just come out. And I was like,
 this guy's like charging 10 bucks, I think it was 10 bucks a month or something to get into this
 thing. I was like, he's got like a thousand people in here. Wow, this is actually, this guy's making
 good money doing this, like just by making a Slack group. You just do a bunch of small
 experiments like that. That's what I know. Sam, what did I miss? I'll give, Peter, let me give
 like the outsider's perspective that's a little more holistic. So basically there's two things
 that are interesting to you. The first one is your businesses, which actually are the least,
 the lesser of the two interesting things. So you have roughly five or, yeah, you have seven
 different businesses ranging from Nomad List, which makes $2.1 million in the last 12 months.
 That's a job board. You have another job board called Remote OK, that's making $115,000 a month.
 You have ReadMate, which looks like it's like an ebook, something like that. Yeah, 60K a month.
 Then you have got like a bunch of really- Sam, you're seeing these numbers because he publishes
 them. Where do you publish these? He publishes all of them on like the URL. Go to his Twitter
 profile and we'll let you talk, sorry, Peter, in a second, but go to his Twitter profile.
 Go to his Twitter profile and then like click off and it's like open revenue at the very bottom.
 But I'm reading off of our notes. And then you have like a QR menu creator. Then you have like
 an inflation chart, which doesn't seem like it makes money, but tracks inflation. And then you
 have Rebase, which is a platform to help people become a citizen of Portugal, help them relocate
 to Portugal. So the first part is those businesses. Like I said, you have those that are
 interesting. I would narrow it down to say you have a series of job boards for nomadic or remote
 work that are pretty profitable. But the second thing that's even more interesting is the way
 that you do these things. So you do a few things that are interesting.
 So
 for the past 10 years, I've been keeping this little notebook with a scratch pad that I call
"
2023-11-03-22-25-26209-001008.flac," And so, you know, it's understood.
 So this is the.
"
2023-11-03-22-25-23210-001007.flac," You see that? Money wisdom. Reminders to self.
 And these are basically just anytime I heard something, I read something, or I learned something that was wise about wealth, I would write it down.
 And I put all the notes here, and today I'm going to read you a bunch of the things that are in this notebook.
 And I feel like I could do that because in most places, you can't really talk about money.
 Money is sort of this tacky, taboo thing.
 Everybody has to pretend they don't care about money, but we all do, which is weird.
 But you just have to treat it like this silent fart in the room.
 You've got to pretend you didn't care about it, pretend it's not there, but it's there.
 And this channel, luckily, is different.
 This is a channel where we come, we talk about business, we talk about money, we talk about mindset, we talk about a bunch of different things that are interesting to us.
 And really, the only people who click on this channel are people that care about those things.
 And so it's like when you go to the gym, you can flex and talk about your pecs because the other people there care about that sort of stuff.
"
2023-11-03-22-25-35210-001009.flac," Money Wisdom Channel.
 I think in the next 15 minutes,
 I don't think this will be long,
 I'll be able to go through a bunch of the nuggets
 I call golden nuggets that I had written down in this.
 The first one.
"
2023-11-03-22-25-41211-001010.flac," I'll start with this.
 The rich aren't just lucky.
 So pretend we took all the money that existed.
"
2023-11-03-22-25-53211-001011.flac," and we redistributed it out.
 Everybody got the same, you know, let's say $100,000 to start with.
 Ten years later, I think that most of the rich people would be rich again
 because wealth building is a skill and it can be learned.
"
2023-11-03-22-27-17256-001012.flac," And for most people, you want to learn this skill, but you don't really know where to start, and I'll give the...
 I write down these sort of three shifts, these big, big, small shifts that you can make. What is a big, small shift?
 So I'll give you a quick story.
 A man wants to learn golf.
 So he goes out, and he buys, you know, some sort of golf clubs, and he goes to the driving range, starts hitting some balls.
 And, you know, it's going left, it's going right, some are going to the center.
 He can't really control it. Doesn't know how to do it. He just started.
 And so he's like, okay, I need to build this skill, but I don't know how. I don't know what I'm doing, to be honest.
 So he sees, you know, right next to him in the driving range, there's a coach teaching a kid.
 So he walks over, he tells the coach, hey, I'd love to learn. Coach says, happy to work with you. First lesson's tomorrow morning.
 Okay, so he shows up again tomorrow morning. You know, this coach teaches him a few things.
 Now the coach, you know, he's sort of a, you know, he's maybe 24 years old. He himself just graduated from college.
 You know, he's not the best in the world. He's just the guy standing next to him.
 But still, it helps.
 He's hitting it a bit better, but not much. The ball's still going left and right.
 And, you know, the man thinks to himself, this coach sucks. I don't want this crappy, this guy's a kid's coach.
 I need a real coach. And so he says, you know what? I'm gonna hire the best. Who's the best coach?
 He goes and finds a professional golfer to be his coach.
 This coach gives him some instructions. Within a few minutes, he's hitting the ball straight. It's going great.
 And so he says, all right, I'm ready to go play. Tomorrow I'm playing a full.
"
2023-11-03-22-28-56216-001013.flac," 18 holes of golf, let's do this.
 Shows up the next day,
 and he's ready to hit the ball straight again,
 but today, things are going different.
 Today, it's slicing left, it's slicing right,
 and he's getting frustrated.
 And the worst part, the thing that's frustrating him the most
 is that the coach is not saying anything.
 He sort of expects the coach to jump in and fix it,
 but the coach is just watching.
 So finally he turns around, he says,
 hey coach, are you gonna do something,
 or are you just gonna stand there?
 All right, like look at me, I'm way off.
 I gotta do something, I gotta change something.
 And the coach just smiles.
 Coach says, you know, you think you're way off,
 but you're really only two millimeters off.
 He said, coach, no offense, I know you're the expert here,
 but pretty sure I'm off by more than two millimeters.
 The ball's gone 100 yards into the lake here.
 And the coach says, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand that.
 The outcome might be far off,
 but you're only off by two millimeters.
 You just need a two millimeter shift.
 You see, because when your golf club hits the ball,
 if it's two millimeters angled in the wrong direction,
 it will completely change the trajectory
 of where a ball is going, right?
 A small shift in the angle here
 is gonna take us in a completely different direction.
 And so he just shows him a couple of tweaks.
 Watch where you're hitting the ball,
 look at the face of the club.
 So he makes the adjustment, takes a swing, nails it.
 And I heard this story first from Tony Robbins,
 and I don't know if it's real or fake or whatever,
 but I love the idea because it really rang true to me.
 Most things in life,
 even if you're far off in your outcome,
 you're actually just only a small shift
 in your approach away
 because that's what changes your trajectory.
 And so here's the small two millimeter shifts
 that I think most people need to make.
"
2023-11-03-22-28-59216-001014.flac," This was after all the money wisdom I collected.
"
2023-11-03-22-31-50214-001015.flac," They all kind of bucketed into these three shifts
 that you can make.
 Shift number one, hard work to smart work.
 Growing up, we're all pretty much told hard work
 is the key to success.
 Our teachers tell us this, our parents tell us this,
 but we gotta ask, is this really true?
 Because I look outside, I see the lawn guy
 mowing the lawn and working in the summer heat.
 He's working hard.
 Or you go into any restaurant,
 go to the back of the kitchen, look at the line cooks.
 Those guys are working hard, they're working crazy hours.
 It's hot out there, it's difficult.
 They're on their feet all day.
 They work Saturdays and Sundays
 because the restaurant doesn't stop.
 They work hard.
 And you start to think about it,
 well, if hard work equals success,
 then why isn't my janitor driving a Bentley, right?
 Because what you work on and who you work with
 is what matters.
 It matters a lot more than how hard you work.
 So again, what you work on,
 the thing you actually choose to do,
 and who you work with will make a far bigger impact
 in your trajectory than just hard work.
 In fact, hard work does help,
 but it's maybe the fifth or sixth
 most important factor, in my opinion.
 I do think there's sort of a minimum,
 like you need to work hard enough,
 but beyond hard enough,
 there's not really like a maximum you should be chasing.
 The goal is not to work as hard as you possibly can.
 Okay, so what should you actually work on?
 I said that's the most important thing.
 Well, Naval Ravikant says it best.
 He says, you want to find the thing
 that feels like play to you and work to others.
 And you should keep dabbling until you find that
 because at first you might say,
 well, what feels like play to me
 is watching Netflix.
 Okay, cool, that feels like play to you,
 but it doesn't look like work to others.
 And so you have to find the thing
 that is play to you, work to others.
 For me, for example, it's business stuff.
 So I am a nerd.
 I love reading about, learning about business.
 I like to go, you know, if a stock is,
 if a company's gonna go public,
 I'll go read the S-1.
 I want to read all about the inner workings of the business.
 To most people, they see this hundred page PDF,
 and it's like you're digging through
 to find the balance sheet or the P&L statement for what?
 Is your boss telling you to do this?
 No, I actually enjoy doing that,
 but to others, it would seem like work.
 And so that's a kind of a sweet spot you want to identify
 and really lean into those types of moments.
 Or this podcast, some people get really nervous
 about public speaking, or it seems like a lot of work,
 or wow, you gotta come up with something,
 you know, an hour worth of stuff to say every two days
 about business, and don't you feel a lot of pressure?
 No, no, this feels like play to me.
 And so if it feels like work to others,
 but it feels like play to you,
 that's the sweet spot.
 That's what you're looking for.
 For some people, that's programming.
 Programming can be a joy to some people,
 and it's a pain to others.
 For some people, it's writing.
 Like I love writing.
 Other people hate writing.
 They think writing is this,
 they still have trauma from school.
 They can't stand writing.
 You know, for my trainer, it's exercise.
 After he trains me and four other people,
 he's been in the gym for six hours straight.
"
2023-11-03-22-32-08201-001017.flac," But that feels like work to me and many others, so.
"
2023-11-03-22-32-05201-001016.flac," Where does he go when he's done? To the gym, because he wants to get his workout in. It's crazy, like, you know, for him,
 exercise and being in the gym feels like play, whereas to others it would feel exhausting. It'd feel like work.
 Hell, Marie Kondo loves cleaning. She made that her thing. She loves cleaning.
"
2023-11-03-22-35-50197-001018.flac," You got to find that thing.
 Why does this matter?
 Because when it feels like play, you'll do it a lot.
 Not just nine to five, you'll do it from five to nine too.
 You'll just do it all the time.
 Any available moment you have,
 your brain will go in that direction
 because it's something you enjoy doing so much.
 And because you enjoy doing it, you'll keep doing it.
 You can do it for a long period of time,
 even if you're not getting immediate results, right?
 There's many things that we will do
 if we get immediate results.
 It's the things you're willing to do
 even without immediate results
 that leads to these big wins in the end.
 And you know what they call the guy
 who practices all the time and never gives up, right?
 So somebody who does it all the time
 and can do it for a long period of time?
 The best.
 That's what they call that guy.
 They call him the best.
 And the best always gets paid.
 In any field, the best plumber gets paid,
 the best nanny gets paid,
 the best whatever you are gets paid.
 And so you want to find the thing
 that feels like play to you
 because it will help you become the best.
 Shift number two.
 So we've gone from hard work to smart work
 and that's finding the thing that feels like play to you
 Now shift number two is
 you want to go from being far away from money
 to hanging out with money.
 So let's pretend you want to get a six pack.
 To get a six pack, to get the abs,
 you need to start thinking and acting like somebody
 who already has a six pack, right?
 Like they make certain choices about how they eat.
 They make certain choices about with like, you know,
 if you travel with somebody who's fit,
 they got in their bag some protein powder, resistance bands.
 They'll pick a hotel based on the gym.
 They make decisions you don't make
 because they have a certain set of priorities
 and habits that you don't have.
 So you got to sort of think like a fit person
 to act like a fit person, then you become a fit person.
 Same goes for wealth.
 You got to think like a wealthy person,
 act like a wealthy person,
 and then you become a wealthy person.
 Most people get this wrong.
 They laugh about this like,
 oh, so I should just, that guy,
 rich guys buy, you know, Ferrari.
 So I should go buy a Ferrari.
 Not really.
 You want to find their habits,
 not their extravagances, right?
 Not their indulgences.
 You want to find their habits.
 You want to hang around with them
 so that you understand what their habits are,
 the small things they do on a day-to-day basis
 that make them who they are,
 and you need to start doing them.
 So you need to shift your way of thinking
 to match the type of person that you want to become.
 All right, so how do you start thinking
 like a wealthy person?
 Well, you got to hang out with them,
 but how do you hang out with them, right?
 Like, you know, they may not be around you.
 You know, what if you don't know anybody?
 So there's three ways.
 The first is peers.
 So you got to find, you know,
 five people with the same dream as you, right?
 Do you know five people who have the same dream as you,
 who are taking it as seriously as you, or more seriously?
 You want to find those people,
 you need to create a group chat.
 You need to create a weekly dinner.
 Hell, move into a house together.
 Do whatever it takes.
 When I wanted to get good at poker,
 I literally lived with a bunch of other people
 who were trying to get good at poker.
 And all day, we're all playing poker.
 We're all talking poker over our meals.
 We're thinking about poker.
 We're asking each other questions.
 We're getting inspired by somebody else's success.
 We're getting bitter about that guy's success,
 but it makes us work harder.
 You want to immerse yourself in an immersive environment
 where you're going to get better.
 And so get as close to it as you can.
 Living together is the best.
 If you can't do living together, get dinners together.
 If you can't do dinners together,
 get in a group chat together, do whatever it takes.
 The second one is mentors.
 So you got your peers, now you want your mentors.
 This is somebody who's already done it.
 You can learn from them.
 The trick here is really simple.
 What most people do wrong
 is they go and ask for you to be their mentor.
 Here's what you actually want to do.
 You want to find somebody who's already done it.
 You want to ask them a specific question.
 Hey, I'm dealing with this situation right now.
 I need to decide between A and B.
 Here's what I'm thinking.
 Could you give me any advice?
