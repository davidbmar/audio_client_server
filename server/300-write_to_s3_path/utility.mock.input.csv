The best metaphor I had, or the best framework I've heard for my career was that everybody goes through three phases in their career. The three phases are, number one, learn, earn, and legacy. So this learn, earn, legacy framework that your career will go into those chapters. The beginning of your career is generally the learn period. This is when you got internships, or you're just starting your first business, you're making a bunch of mistakes, or you go work at a bigger company just to see what it's like, and you're getting your experience. That's the learn phase of your career. What's most important in the learn phase of your career is what you optimize for. So, one job offers you an extra $15,000, the other job offers you $15,000 less, which job should you take? Most people take the one that pays them the extra 15K a year, which is like 9K after taxes or something like that. And even though the other job would have been a far better learning experience for them. They were going to get way more hands-on experience working with way smarter people on more interesting projects, which in the long run would have paid off in a much bigger way. So, why is it important to know you're in the learn phase? Because you know what to prioritize. Your key KPI is how much learning per month am I doing? How much am I growing per month as a person? I'm building me as a product right now. That's the learn phase. Earn phase is now, I've built myself as a product. I have the skills. I know what to do. I understand the market. And I can actually go and I can reap what I've sowed. So, I can actually...  "

It's how you remember for doing something that's beyond yourself contributing. I think this framework is a good framework for a career. I think it's the natural evolution of a successful career. That's the first thing I would keep in mind. So those first 10 years, and I say 10 years because 10 years sounds like a long time, but it's "

Just like we date before we get married, you want to do the same thing with your career. So you're going to be dabbling.  So you should be expecting to, I don't know, every 18 months turn over and reinvent yourself and hop into a new situation to keep challenging yourself. And what you're trying to do is not trying to change. You're using change to find the thing that you are uniquely capable of. And that's the next key lesson. I can't find this client info.

And what that means is that people will help you.  Like I can't tell you how many meetings I got with amazing people, how many opportunities I got, how many times I got to shadow somebody or ride along with somebody because I just told him like, Hey, I think what you do is amazing.
