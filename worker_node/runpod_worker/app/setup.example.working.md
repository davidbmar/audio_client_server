Let me help identify the key commands that got Faster Whisper working. From the logs, here are the essential commands you should run in order:

1. First, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source ~/faster-whisper-env/bin/activate
```

2. Install/upgrade the required packages:
```bash
pip install faster-whisper torch
pip install --upgrade pip  # Optional but recommended
```

3. Run the worker node:
```bash
python worker_node_v2.py
```

The logs show that initially there were some issues with finding faster-whisper, but after running these commands, it successfully:
- Detected CUDA with Tesla T4
- Started processing audio files
- Successfully detected English language in the audio with high probability

Note that the `start.txt` file you looked at contained different commands (using conda/whisperenv), but the successful execution came from using the `faster-whisper-env` virtual environment instead.

The key indicators of success in the logs were:
```
✓ faster-whisper found
✓ CUDA available: Tesla T4
```

Followed by successful processing messages like:
```
Processing audio with duration 00:04.980
Detected language 'en' with probability 0.98
```

Just make sure you're in the correct directory (`~/audio_client_server/worker_node/runpod_worker/app`) when running these commands.
