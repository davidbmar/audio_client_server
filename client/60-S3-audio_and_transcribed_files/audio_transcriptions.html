 specific and niche here, and off the beaten path.
 So here's what you're going to do.
 Now when any company starts, a tech company starts, that's going to be QSBS eligible.
 That QSBS eligibility is...
 You have to say what QSBS is.
 Oh, sorry.
 QSBS is a tax treatment for qualified small business stock.
 What that means is that if you're a business that fits like these five criteria, which
 most tech companies fit, then when you sell, if you've held the stock for five years, or
 even if it's a little bit less than that, you can still kind of roll it over, your first
 $10 million of your gain are going to be tax free.
 Not only most tech companies, most new C-corps that hold for five years would fall under
 this.
 There are some exceptions.
 Like you can't do it if you're a doctor or lawyer or real estate, like there are things
 that are excluded.
 But again, that's kind of the point here.
 It's QSBS advisory.
 We're going to help you figure out, are you eligible or not?
 And we're going to provide a letter that says, we attest to the belief that this is going
 to be qualified small business stock.
 Now, why is this easy to do?
 Why is my strategy?
 Well, if I'm trying to make money, it's kind of like you described with the membership.
 I need to create 10 times more than I'm taking.
 This is a general rule of life.
 That's probably a good rule of life.
 Create more value than you're trying to take.
 And that's what I'd be trying to do here.
 I was looking for something where with a small amount of work, I could create a lot of value
 for my customer.
 Well, that sounds generic, but like in this case, if my stock is going to be QSBS eligible,
 that might save me $10 million down the road, and that's a pretty big, huge benefit.
 So would I pay $5,000 or $10,000 in legal fees, in advisory fees, in order to protect
 my possible $10 million gain?
 I would.

 we are QSBS experts. We know the ins and outs of QSBS, we're respected. I would hire maybe lawyers
 or accountants that have done this before. And I would say, hey, on an as-needed basis,
 when I get a customer, I will pay you whatever, $300 an hour, $500 an hour for your time to do
 an assessment and write a letter that basically assesses the eligibility you think for QSBS.
 Now QSBS is not like a black and white thing. It's not like a... QSBS is basically when you
 get the sale, you declare, you say, this falls under QSBS. But if you ever got audited,
 you'd have to be able to defend that. Why did you say it was QSBS eligible?
 And so what companies and individuals do is they will go get a letter that basically says,
 we as experts have looked at this business and we believe that this is going to be QSBS,
 this is qualified small business stock. You know, like the 409. What's it called?
 The 409. Yeah.
 409. So in order to do a bunch of stuff with your business, a lot of times,
 tech companies have to get valued every year. Every year. Every year you should get valued.
 And then that also is necessary when you want to issue new stock or whatever,
 for employees or for investors, you set a benchmark.
 But there's a lot of companies that do this as a service where you spend $5,000 to $10,000.
 And you don't actually give them that much information. You give them your financials.
 And then they ask you to submit like 10 publicly traded competitors. And then they just like say,
 all right, we think that your valuation is blank. And you spend $5,000 to $10,000,
 I think, for that. You're basically...
 You want it to be low, usually. So usually what you're trying to do is get a low 499A
 so that every base of options are priced low. So it's like, you're not even like you're trying
 to justify a high valuation. You're actually trying to justify a low valuation in most cases.
 It's kind of crony capitalism a little bit. They'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 We'll make it low. We'll be fair. And then they wink at you.

 suggesting is doing the same thing for QSBS.
 Yeah, and 49A is an equally valid idea. But what I would do is I would create
 this for him. What I like about the QSBS thing is it's a little bit higher ticket.
 So typically, these people will charge, let's say, 10 to $15,000 for the initial
 attestation letter. I don't know if I'm saying that word right. But then on top of that,
 you could even charge kind of like an ongoing fee because there are all these like footfalls.
 So it's not just like a, there is some genuine help. So for example,
 oh, you're going to sell secondary, there's things you might do wrong when you sell secondary that
 could disqualify you, there's disqualifying events. And so, you know, you can't bill for
 revenue in specific ways, it's categorized as X, it might take you out of QSBS eligibility.
 And so it's just an insurance policy to cover your ass. It's a legal thing. It's something people
 don't want to do themselves just too high risk to do yourself. And you literally can't do it
 yourself because you can't write the letter for yourself. And so you don't have to have it,
 but it is a nice to have. And what I would do is I would go scare the living shit out of every
 tech company that I find on Crunchbase. And I would say, don't you want this $10 million
 exclusion for you? It's per person, by the way, it's not per company. So it's per tax return.
 So let's say there's a company that's going to be big. Every single one of those executives is
 going to want their stock to be QSBS eligible. And so I would go to them and I would scare the
 living shit out of them that they might get this wrong. And I would tell them, don't worry,
 we can cover this for you. And here's how we'll cover it for you. Pay us, whatever.
 Either the lump sum upfront or a monthly recurring fee or an annual recurring fee $1,500 a year,
 $2,000 a year. And we will kind of make sure we're your advisory on that so that, you know,
 you're covered at the end of the day. That's a pretty brilliant idea, actually.
 You know, if you just think about it, right, how do you get to, let's say, we talked about
 to sell a company for over a million dollars, let's just round up and say you got to have $300,000 of
